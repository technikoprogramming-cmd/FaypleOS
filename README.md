#nikodem's FaypleOS
Do you have an (apple) iPad that maybe not being used or you have js got your self a diffrent tablet like newer iPad or samsung tablet or xiaomi and you dont know what to do with it, turn in into a nas server with Nikodem's FaypleOS 
Imainge a trully privete data cloud no-tracking. Easy setup no more subscription max security cause to get into your server

People will need

To be on the same wifi network
NFOSS app or local hosted website .html
Or windows app 
Or linux app
Or MacOS app
Or iOS 1conf1g profile app

What ever it is 
They will need your username 
They will need app password
They will need server password 

And if you susspect someone on the server (your own cloud) you can js click stop server on your device of choice to be a server and then change password en username but have to update .html aswell then its easy and simple 

Another security that i offer is raner
So when you have phtotos 
You gonna put your photos, videos in a folder zip it password it. Then upload it 
Then you gonna do the same thing to documents .zip but every file diffrent password if you have music same thing apks same thing .zip password diffrent
So when someone dose bypass the whole thing they will have to decrypt all the folders like
Photos-3.zip
Mydata.zip

Etc

And when you wanna add a new photos documents all you do is make a new zip password it

For example
Photos-2.zip
Photos-1.zip
And either have same passwords for same file typs of difdrent to make hackers life harder

So photos from 2020
Coule have password like
Photos-2020.zip example1
And photos-2026 you uploaded could have password like
Edamdjfj19

For max security

They will need to have the iP
And last port

So 8-securitys to byppas
Called NikoThing
